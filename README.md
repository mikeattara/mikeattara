### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm **Mike Perry Attara**, a software engineer with a background in teaching science and mathematics.
 
 I'm passionate about building products with delightful user experiences, and a desire to constantly learn and improve.

My strength lies within a solid understanding of the core **JavaScript** language, with hands-on experience in recent years in building scalable web applications using modern JavaScript tools like **React**, **Redux** and **Node.js** and spend some time contributing to open source projects and teaching at workshops and meetups, as I care about giving back to the community.

I sometimes get my hands dirty with **Python**, **Typescript**, **Ruby on Rails**, **Docker/Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines** using `Github Actions`, `CircleCI`, `Travis`, `Helm`, `ArgoCD`, etc

I enjoy working with people, and learning new tools, best practices, and skills for building, delivering and maintaining resilient software solutions.
