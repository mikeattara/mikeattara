### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm **Mike Perry Attara**, an agile-minded JavaScript engineer with a passion for building meaningful products, and an ardent believer in continuous learning of both technical and soft skills to improve my ability to deliver great software solutions.

My strengths lie within a solid understanding of the core *JavaScript* language, *HTML5*, and *CSS3*, with hands-on experience in recent years in building scalable web applications using modern JavaScript tools like *React* and *Redux* and spend some time contributing to open source projects and teaching at workshops and meetups, as I care about giving back to the community.

I'm able to work independently and also collaborate effectively in a team environment through open communication.
